      <h3>Why on Earth would I want chickens when I can get a dozen eggs for $2?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Many (but not all) breeds of chicken make friendly, funny pets.</li>
        <li>Free-range eggs look and taste better (and are probably more nutritious).</li>
        <li>Chickens take care of fertilizing your yard and eat a lot of bugs.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Okay, but aren't they a lot of work and expense?</h3>
      <p>They're no more difficult or expensive than a cat, and when's the last time your cat fed you?!</p>
